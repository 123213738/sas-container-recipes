# SAS Viya Deployment
Using containers to build, customize, and deploy a SAS environment in Kubernetes based on your software order.

## Getting Started

#### Install a maintained version of docker-ce
See the official Docker Community Edition install steps: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/

### Start a private Docker Registry
This will be the location that your Kubernetes pulls images from.
For details steps see the official Docker site: https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/

#### Raise the timeout period for Docker
`echo 'ENV DOCKER_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=600' >> /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible_container-0.9.2-py2.7.egg/container/docker/templates/conductor-local-dockerfile.j2`

#### Install Ansible Container for running the build steps
`pip install ansible-container` 
If you're using a virtual environment then see the instructions [on our wiki](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-container-recipes/wiki).

#### Install Kubernetes
See the official Kubernetes site: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

### Build
Download this repository to use the build script.
`git clone https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-container-recipes.git`

Define some variables that point to your Software Order Email zip file and your Docker registry location.
The `build.sh` tool creates Docker images from your software order, pushes them to your docker registry, and creates Kubernetes deployment files.
```
DOCKER_REGISTRY_URL=<my-docker-registry-url> \
DOCKER_REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=$(echo $USER) \
ORDER_LOCATION=/my/path/to/SAS_Viya_deployment_data.zip \
./build.sh
```

### Deploy
Kubernetes files are automatically placed into the `deploy/` directory. 
```
kubectl create -f deploy/configmap/
kubectl create -f deploy/secrets/
kubectl create -f deploy/deployments/
```
