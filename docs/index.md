# SAS Container Recipes
At the forefront of digital transformation is the need for IT to support data science teams, while 
taking advantage of cost-efficient cloud infrastructures. There is also an insatiable need for flexibility 
and agility in architectures for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Containers have become the 
go-to approach to deploying software in today’s cloud platforms.  

SAS customers can now create container deployments of the SAS Platform execution engines.  
This includes support for Docker containers and Kubernetes for orchestration. By facilitating 
the execution of SAS workloads in a more compact and elastic way, IT allows the organization 
to turn data into decisions, scale to any challenge, and attain agility in both public and private 
clouds.

## Rapid adoption.
As business and IT roles work more closely together, organizations are 
quickly adopting cloud technologies. It is becoming a widespread and common practice 
to place various computing layers into containers rather than into virtual environments. 

## Data locality. 
Many data sources are being migrated or accumulated in cloud platforms.
It is becoming a best practice to locate data and analytics processing as close to the data 
as possible. 

## Flexibility. 
Both IT and business organizations are looking at more ways to instantiate 
methods and tools to solve analytical challenges. This includes embracing both open 
source and commercial container solutions.

## Scalability. 
Containers start and stop significantly faster than traditional virtual machines 
and use fewer OS resources. This allows IT or data scientists to instantiate multiple 
instances of SAS, either the SAS 9.4 engine or SAS® Viya®, to meet the wide variety 
and scale of computing demand.

## Agility. 
Data scientists can use containers to gain access to preconfigured environments, 
upgrade to new releases, promote through dev/test/prod standards, and easily manage 
code and application versioning.
