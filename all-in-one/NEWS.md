# 10AUG2018 -- Added install_vendor for hadoop and oracle

The install vendor script looks for folders like ```vendor/hadoop``` and ```vendor/oracle```.  If you copy the required vendor artefacts into these subdirectories, the script will configure them into the container for you.  Details are in [VENDOR.md](VENDOR.md)
