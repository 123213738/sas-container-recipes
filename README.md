# Background
A collection of recipes for building containers with SAS and other tools.

* [viya-programming](viya-programming/README.md) is a set of tools for creating SAS Viya 3.4 containers.
* [addons](addons/README.md) is a set of tools for adding to the SAS Viya 3.4 containers.
* [utilities](utilities/README.md) is a set of files that can be used when creating SAS Viya 3.4 containers.
* [all-in-one](all-in-one/README.md) is a set of tools for creating a SAS Viya 3.3 single container, for convenience and simplicity for the person using said container.

# Prerequisites

* A SAS order and the SAS_Viya_deployment_data.zip from the Software Order Email (SOE)
* A [supported version](https://success.docker.com/article/maintenance-lifecycle) of Docker(https://www.docker.com/)
* Git

# How to clone from GitHub

These examples are for a Linux host that has Git and Docker installed.  
You can clone on Windows (with Powershell), and on a Mac too. 
To keep the example simple, we'll put the cloned folder in your $HOME directory.

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-container-recipes.git
```

# How To Quickly Build a SAS Viya 3.4 Image

At the root level of this repository, there is a script called _build.sh_. 
Once you have cloned the _sassoftware/sas-container-recipes_ project, you can run 
_build.sh_ to quickly build a set of Docker images that represent a SAS Viya 3.4 
image and a SAS Viya 3.4 image with a default user. 

The following example assumes that you are in the _$HOME/sas-container-recipes_ 
directory and that you want to add a demo user to allow you to log into SAS Studio 
when the container is running.

```
cp /path/to/SAS_Viya_deployment_data.zip viya-programming/viya-single-container
build.sh addons/auth-demo
```

Running _build.sh_ will print what is happening to the console as well as to a 
file named _build_sas_container.log_.

When this example build completes, execute _docker images_ to see the images produced:

```
REPOSITORY                                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
svc-auth-demo                              latest              965b522a213d        21 hours ago        8.52GB
viya-single-container                      latest              2351f556f15a        2 days ago          8.52GB
centos                                     latest              5182e96772bf        6 weeks ago         200MB
```

Note that the size of the _viya-single-container_ and _svc-auth-demo_ vary depending on your order.

Also, there are not two images of the same size, 8.52 GB for this example, on the 
system. The _svc-auth-demo_ image is a small image layer stacked on the 
_viya-single-container_ image, which is a large image layer stacked on the _centos_ image.

Once the container is built one can run the container via the _docker run_ command

```
docker run \
    --detach \
    --rm \
    --env CASENV_CAS_VIRTUAL_HOST=$(hostname) \
    --env CASENV_CAS_VIRTUAL_PORT=8081 \
    --publish-all \
    --publish 8081:80 \
    --name svc-auth-demo \
    --hostname svc-auth-demo \
    svc-auth-demo

# Check the status
docker ps --filter name=svc-auth-demo --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}} \t{{.Ports}}"
CONTAINER ID        NAMES               IMAGE               STATUS              PORTS
4b426ce49b6b        svc-auth-demo       svc-auth-demo       Up 2 minutes        0.0.0.0:8081->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:33221->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:33220->5570/tcp
```

Now go to the __http://\<hostname of Docker host\>:8081__ and login as user _sasdemo_ with password _sasdemo_.

# Frequently Asked Questions
## Errors when building the Docker image
### ERRO[0000] failed to dial gRPC: cannot connect to the Docker daemon

For Linux hosts, make sure the Docker daemon is running. 

```
sudo systemctl status docker
‚óè docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2018-08-08 06:57:53 EDT; 1 months 12 days ago
     Docs: https://docs.docker.com
 Main PID: 24833 (dockerd)
    Tasks: 104
```

If the process is running, then one may need to execute the Docker commands with
_sudo_. To remove the need for _sudo_, see the [post install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
provided by Docker.

### COPY failed: stat /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builderXXXXXXXXXX/\<file name\>: no such file or directory

Dockerfiles will attempt to copy files from directory where the current directory.
In some cases the user is expected to copy files into the current directory. This
is needed for building the _viya-single-container_ image as well as some of the 
addons. If the file is not present, the Docker build process will have an error
message like the title of this section. To resolve it, make sure the file that is
needed resides in the directory where the _docker build_ is taking place.

### Ansible playbook fails 

Usually this will be due to Docker running out of space on the host where the Docker
daemon is running. Look back through the Ansible output and see if there is a message
like

```
        "Error Summary",
        "-------------",
        "Disk Requirements:",
        "  At least 6344MB more space needed on the / filesystem."
```

If this is happening, try pruning the Docker system

```
docker system prune --force --volumes
```

Even after pruning, if this error persists, double check the storage driver for Docker:

```
docker system info 2>/dev/null | grep "Storage Driver"
```

If the returning value is _Storage Driver: devicemapper_ then this could be the 
source of the issue. _devicemapper_ has a default layer size of 10 GB and the SAS
image is usually bigger than this limit. One can try to change the size or switch to
the [overlay2 driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/).


## Warnings when building the Docker image
### warning: /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7/**/*.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA256 Signature, key ID \<key\>: NOKEY

This is indicating that the Gnu Privacy Guard (gpg) key is not available on the host. 
When seeing this message, it is followed by a call to retrieve the missing key.
It is safe to ignore this warning.
