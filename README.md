# SAS Container Recipes
Using containers to build, customize, and deploy a SAS environment based on your software order.

### Viya for Individuals
A quick, short-term, hackable environment within a single Dockerfile.
The `viya-programming` section is tailored for most independent data scientists, with a quickstart for running a SAS Studio + CAS (Cloud Analytic Software) locally on your own machine.

### Viya for Teams: 
The `viya-visuals` section is for large organizations deploying scalable clusters using Kubernetes.

    - SAS Studio + CAS (Cloud Analytic Software) = Massive Parallel Processing (MPP)
    - Visual Analytics
    - Visual Forecasting
    - Visual Data Mining & Machine Learning
    ... and all other visual (non-programming) applications.

## Additional Features
The `addons` directory provides details for utilizing data access tools, authentication, security, and third-party extras.
